h2kvm - Hypervisor to KVM Migration Library

A comprehensive tool for migrating virtual machines from various hypervisors
(VMware, Hyper-V, Azure) to KVM/libvirt.

Usage as a library:

    from h2kvm import Orchestrator, GuestDetector, VMwareClient

    # Detect guest OS
    detector = GuestDetector()
    guest = detector.detect('/mnt/disk')

    # Migrate from VMware
    client = VMwareClient(host='vcenter.example.com', ...)
    orchestrator = Orchestrator(vmware_client=client)
    result = orchestrator.run()

See docs/08-Library-API.md for detailed usage examples.
